# conversion_rate_project

# Project 🚧

The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to better understand the behavior of the users visiting their website.  
Their main goal is to know whether it's possible to **predict if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter** using just a few pieces of information about them.  

They also want to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight the most important features explaining users’ behavior — and maybe discover new levers for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

They designed a **competition** aiming at building a model that predicts conversions (i.e., when a user will subscribe to the newsletter).  
To do so, they **open-sourced a dataset** containing data about website traffic.  
The **evaluation metric** for the competition is the **F1-score**.

## Goals 🎯

The project can be divided into four parts:

### Part 1
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Apply **preprocessing**
- Train a **baseline model** with `data_train.csv`

### Part 2
- Improve the model’s **F1-score** on the test set
- Possible approaches:
  - Feature engineering  
  - Feature selection  
  - Regularization  
  - Non-linear models  
  - Hyperparameter optimization (grid search, etc.)

### Part 3
- Use the best-performing model to make predictions with `data_test.csv`
- Dump predictions into a `.csv` file for submission  
  (to **Kaggle** — or, in this case, to your **teacher/TA 🤓**)  
- Multiple submissions are allowed — feel free to experiment with different models!

### Part 4
- Analyze the parameters of your best model  
- Identify **levers for action** to improve the newsletter's conversion rate  
- Make **recommendations** to the team

## Deliverables 📬

Your team should provide:

- 📊 Relevant figures for **EDA**  
- 🤖 At least one **model** that predicts conversions and evaluates performance (F1-score, confusion matrices)  
- 📈 At least one **submission** to the leaderboard  
- 📝 An **analysis of the best model’s parameters**, with recommendations to improve the conversion rate in the future
